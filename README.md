# SneakerDon

SneakerDon is a front-end application that tracks prices of sneakers using the Sneaks API [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sneaks-api) from the top 4 most popular marketplaces on the web. 

- Stock X
- GOAT
- FlightClub
- Stadium Goods




# Process

The technologies used to make this app were 

- Next.js (Frontend)
- Express.js (Creating API endpoints for data)
- Figma (Desiging app and its features)

I initially created a design on figma for the app, on both desktop and mobile devices with the following features.

- Searching 
- Dynamic Routing on Products
- Live Tracking of Price data
- Related Products

In terms of data fetching I learn't I mixture of different data fetching techniques such as client-side data fetching and server side data fetching.
# Final Thoughts

Thought this project was quite a small project, I've enjoyed learning the Next.js framework and learning how to create and use simple API endpoints to fetch data. Sneakers are a great passion of mine and in the future I wish to expand this project with more features and hopefully turn this into a full-stack application.
